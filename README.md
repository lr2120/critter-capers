Critter Capers: Information about predators and prey in our ecosystem

Critter Capers is a C++20 based application using SFML that gathers insights by combining data from the Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) opensoure dataset and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). This combination allows quick access to translations of taxon name (scientific name) to thea common name of a species and vice versa. It also identifies keystone species, specifically predators who eat the largest variety of prey.
